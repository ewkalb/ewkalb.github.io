Soon after he graduated to his dad’s Winchester model 74 .22 caliber rifle. In the 9th grade, he began sharing this skill with others when he started helping run rifle ranges at summer camp.

                        Over the years he has taught hundreds of people to shoot safely and helped many of them improve their skill levels. He also continues to practice improving his own firearm skills and add new ones. His latest new skill being an interest in long range shooting.
                        
                        With over three decades of experience teaching leadership skills in a wilderness environment as a hobby, it was a natural move to pursue this in retirement. So, after retiring from a rewarding telecommunications career in 2016, he began a venture teaching outdoor living and survival skills.
                        
                         When not at the range, Dwight and his wife enjoy travelling, hiking, fine cuisine, spending time with friends, and taking their two dogs on regular walks.
